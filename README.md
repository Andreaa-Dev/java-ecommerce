# E-Commerce Backend (Java)

## Overview

This is the backend of an e-commerce website built using Java. The backend manages the core functionality of the platform, including user authentication, product management, order handling, and category organization. The system is designed following RESTful principles and connects to a relational database to store and retrieve data efficiently.

## Features

- **User Management**: Registration, login, role-based access (e.g., customer, admin).
- **Product Management**: CRUD operations for products, including categorization.
- **Category Management**: Organize products into categories for easy navigation.
- **Order Processing**: Add items to the cart, checkout, and manage orders.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different functionalities for admin and customer roles.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Backend logic and APIs.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for rapid development.
- **Hibernate**: ORM for database interactions.
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing entities.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build tool.
- **REST API**: For communication between frontend and backend.
